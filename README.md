# Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning

A machine learning project designed to automate and enhance the loan approval decision-making process.
This model predicts whether a loan application should be Approved or Rejected based on demographic, financial, and credit-related factors.

## Project Overview

Financial institutions handle thousands of loan applications daily, often requiring manual review that is slow, error-prone, and inconsistent.
This project builds a data-driven, automated loan approval prediction system that:

✔ Enhances decision accuracy
✔ Reduces human bias
✔ Speeds up loan processing
✔ Improves customer satisfaction

The ML model is trained on historical loan data and predicts loan eligibility using applicant attributes such as income, credit score, employment details, and financial ratios.
